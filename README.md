# 🩺 Multi-Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning and Streamlit

This project presents a **web-based multi-disease prediction system** capable of forecasting three major diseases—**Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease**—based on user-inputted health parameters. Built using **Python**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, and **Streamlit**, the application offers a simple and interactive interface for real-time disease assessment.
